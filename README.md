## My process

For this project, I followed a structured approach to ensure efficiency and a successful outcome. The steps I took include:

- Project Brief Analysis: I started by thoroughly analyzing the project brief, understanding the requirements, and identifying key deliverables.

- Planning: I created a project plan outlining the tasks, timelines, and milestones to keep the project on track.

- Design and Wireframing: I worked on the design phase, creating wireframes and sketches to visualize the project's layout and structure.

- Development: I implemented the design using HTML and CSS, ensuring responsiveness for different screen sizes.

- Testing: I rigorously tested the project on various browsers and devices to identify and fix any compatibility issues.

- Optimization: I focused on optimizing the project for performance, ensuring fast loading times and efficient code.

- Documentation: I created this project documentation to provide insights into the project's development process, tools used, and key decisions made.


### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup: I used HTML5 for structuring the project's content.
- CSS custom properties: CSS3 was utilized for styling and Sass 
- (SCSS): I employed Sass, a powerful CSS preprocessor, to enhance the maintainability and organization of my styles. This allowed me to use features like variables, nesting, and mixins for more efficient styling.
- Flexbox:  I used Flexbox for flexible and responsive layout design
- CSS Grid: CSS Grid was implemented for grid-based layout structures.


### What I learned

In completing the Frontend Mentor QR code component challenge, I learned valuable skills including HTML, CSS, responsive design, image handling, flexbox, positioning, problem-solving, version control, code organization, best practices, attention to detail, self-learning, and design skills. This project provided hands-on experience.




### Continued development

In my journey as a frontend developer, I recognize the need for continued development in refining my CSS skills to create more intricate and visually appealing designs. I also aim to enhance my proficiency in JavaScript to add interactivity and functionality to my projects. Additionally, I'll continue exploring responsive web design to ensure seamless user experiences across various devices. These skills will not only elevate my career prospects but also allow me to take on more complex and challenging projects, solidifying my position as a well-rounded and adaptable developer.
